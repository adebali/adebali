  "about":"I am a computational biologist currently working as a postdoc in a joint lab between University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I enjoy working on genomics, analyzing sequences and building scientific tools. The ultimate aim of my research is to understand the complex cellular pathways, disease-causing mutations by using the evolutionary information. I believe that a huge amount of information resides in the sequence data, which needs to be converted to knowledge. This is where I step into the game."

Domain identification in proteins is one of my interests as they can define proteins. Especially some complex proteins composed of multiple domains are identified based on their domain architectures. Specific domain combinations perform specific functions. Therefore, studies on domain architectures are helpful in revealing function and homology.

Paralogs, on the other hand, are related through gene duplication in a current or an ancestral organism. Orthologous proteins tend to conserve the same function while paralogs likely diverge. Current orthology identification methods result in one-to-many orthologous relationships as well as one-to-one. In the case of one-to-one orthology, the picture is clear. However, one-to-many orthologs bring some problems in grouping functionally equivalent members. Phylogenetics is a great method to distinguish orthologs from paralogs. It is also powerful in distinguishing functionally equivalent groups within co-orthologs.
